# Stack and Queue Abstract Data Types

This project implements fundamental abstract data types,
including stacks and FIFO queues, using singly linked lists.

The project also includes an application that uses a stack
to solve a maze traversal problem via backtracking.

---

## Implemented Components

- Stack ADT with O(1) operations
- Queue ADT with O(1) operations
- Alternative queue implementation using a circular list
  and a single pointer
- Maze traversal application using stack-based backtracking

---

## Notes

This project was developed as part of academic coursework.
The implementation focuses on correctness and algorithmic
design rather than full production-level completeness.
