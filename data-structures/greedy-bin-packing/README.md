# Greedy Bin Packing with Priority Queues

This project explores greedy strategies for a simplified
version of the Bin Packing problem.

The implementation focuses on the use of priority queues
and sorting algorithms to approximate efficient disk
allocation solutions.

## Implemented Concepts

- Disk abstraction with capacity constraints
- Priority Queue (MaxPQ) for greedy selection
- Greedy allocation strategy
- Sorting-based improvement (greedy-decreasing approach)

---

## Notes

This project was developed as part of academic coursework.
The implementation focuses on algorithmic reasoning and
data structure usage rather than full optimization or
complete experimental evaluation.
